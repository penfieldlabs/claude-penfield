# Penfield Memory - Quick Reference

Display this help information to the user:

## You Just Talk Naturally

Penfield lets your AI remember things across conversations. You don't need commands - just talk naturally.

## Remembering Things

Say things like:
- "Remember this: I prefer morning meetings, not afternoons"
- "Don't forget - Sarah handles legal, John handles IT"
- "Store this decision: We're focusing on enterprise this quarter"

You can tag memories for organization:
- "Remember this and tag it as 'legal': Sarah handles all IP matters"

## Recalling Things

Start a new conversation with **"Awaken"** to load your context, then ask naturally:
- "What did we decide about the pricing strategy?"
- "What do you know about Project Atlas?"
- "What did we discuss last week?"

If your AI doesn't seem to be checking memories, say: "Check your memories first"

## Fixing Wrong Information

- "Update memory: I said Sarah handles legal, but actually it's John"
- "Correction - we're NOT focusing on enterprise anymore. Please update."

## Connecting Ideas

Usually automatic, but you can be explicit:
- "Connect this decision to our discussion about customer feedback"
- "This contradicts what we thought before - link them"

## Project Checkpoints

Save: "Save a checkpoint for Project Alpha - include everything we discussed"
Resume: "Restore the checkpoint for Project Alpha"

## Artifacts (File Storage)

- "Save this as my standard PR template artifact"
- "Get my PR template artifact"
- "List my saved artifacts"

## Exploring Connections

- "Explore connections related to our Q3 strategy"
- "Show me what's connected to Project Atlas"

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific** - Include context and reasoning, not just facts
2. **Correct mistakes immediately** - "Update memory: the correct info is..."
3. **Quality over quantity** - Store what matters next week/month/year
